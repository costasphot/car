# Car Project

This project represents a simple car simulation with different versions. Each version may have specific features or improvements.

## Versions

If you want to know more about each version's improvements or any other information, you may check each version's 'README.md' file. The latest functionalities of my car project can be found in the most recently uploaded version.

**Note**: The first three versions only have a template `README.md` file, for the reason being that this is my first project and I didn't know much about how a proper project structure looks like.

## Common Headers

The `common_headers` directory contains header files shared across all versions (at least I'll try to be consistent for the most recent ones).

**Note**: The first three versions have no common headers, because the very first one was not introduced until the 4th version of my project.

## Build Artifacts

Build artifacts, such as executables and DLLs, are located in the `build` directories within each version.

## Explore Source Code

Feel free to explore the source code in the `src` and `include` directories for each version.

## Documentation

In addition to the project structure mentioned above, there is also a `docs` folder containing additional documentation, guides, and supplementary materials.

## License

This project is licensed under the [License Name] - see the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file for details.

## Why?

The reason why I started this project is for self-improvement and learn C++ better.
